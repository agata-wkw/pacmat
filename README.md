# pacmat
A (__work in progress__) wrapper for a python module to calculate phase-amplitude coupling.
Matlab 2014b or later required. Python installation with numpy and scipy required.

This wrapper will return errors until the statsmodels dependency is removed and it is updated.

The python module can be found at, https://github.com/voytekresearch/pacpy
